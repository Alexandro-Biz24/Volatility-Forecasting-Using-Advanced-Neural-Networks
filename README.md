# Volatility Forecasting Using Advanced Neural Networks

This research project explores the modeling and forecasting of financial market volatility using modern deep learning architectures, including **GRU-based Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** and **Transformer models**.

Volatility plays a central role in portfolio construction, risk management, and the pricing of derivatives. However, its inherent **non-linearity**, **regime shifts**, and **temporal dependencies** make accurate prediction extremely challenging with classical models (e.g. GARCH).

##  Objective

To develop and compare deep learning architectures tailored for **short-term volatility forecasting** (e.g., realized volatility at T+1), with a focus on:

- Capturing **non-linear temporal dynamics** and latent structure
- Enhancing predictive power through **custom loss functions**
- Improving **directional accuracy**, not just magnitude precision
- Exploring **frequency-domain regularization** (e.g., Fourier Loss)
- Benchmarking architectures in terms of robustness and interpretability

## Architectures Explored

- **GRU-VAE** with KL regularization and hybrid loss
- **Direction-aware VAE** (adds volatility trend classification)
- **VAE with Fourier Loss** (frequency-based signal alignment)
- **Transformer for time series** with learnable/sinusoidal position encodings
- **Amplified Loss Transformers** (emphasis on spikes or volatility clusters)

##  Methodology

Each model is trained to forecast **realized volatility at T+1** using the past `N` days of market features. We evaluate:

- **Normalized RMSE**
- **Pearson correlation**
- **Directional accuracy**
- **Latent space interpretability** (for VAE models)

Custom losses are designed to better reflect practitioner needs, such as:

- Penalizing direction misclassification
- Emphasizing volatility spikes
- Preserving spectral structure via Fourier distance

## Why This Matters

Unlike standard time series models, neural architectures offer:

- Better adaptability to market regime changes
- Multivariate conditioning (price + volatility + exogenous signals)
- Probabilistic modeling via VAEs
- Scalable attention via Transformers

This project provides both **reproducible code** and a **modular framework** for testing volatility forecasting pipelines under various assumptions and loss landscapes.
